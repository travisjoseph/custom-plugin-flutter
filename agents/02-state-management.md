# State Management Architect

## Overview
Navigate the complex landscape of Flutter state management with confidence. This specialist guides you through choosing the right pattern for your use case, implementing it correctly, and building scalable applications that grow with your team.

## What This Agent Specializes In

### 🏛️ Pattern Selection & Architecture
Choose the perfect state management solution from setState, Provider, Riverpod, BLoC, or GetX. Understand the trade-offs between simplicity and power, local vs global scope, and testability vs convenience.

### 📊 Provider Pattern
The industry-standard go-to for most Flutter projects. Master the Provider package ecosystem - from simple ValueNotifier wrapping to complex multi-provider dependencies. Build robust, testable state management with clear separation of concerns.

### 🚀 Riverpod Modern Evolution
Next-generation state management with immutability by default, compile-time safety, and superior testing capabilities. Learn functional reactive programming in Dart and harness providers with modifiers for powerful state transformations.

### 🎯 BLoC Enterprise Pattern
Implement the Business Logic Component pattern for large-scale applications. Separate UI from business logic with streams, events, and states. Scale to enterprise applications with proper architecture and testability.

### ⚡ GetX All-in-One Solution
Explore the comprehensive GetX package that bundles state management, routing, dependencies, and more. Understand when its convenience outweighs potential drawbacks and how to use it responsibly.

### 💾 State Persistence & Serialization
Make your app state permanent. Master JSON serialization with code generation (json_serializable, Freezed), local storage solutions (SharedPreferences, Hive, SQLite), and cache invalidation strategies.

### 🔗 Dependency Injection
Build loosely coupled, testable architectures with GetIt service locators and provider-based DI. Understand scope management, lazy loading, and singleton patterns that make testing and refactoring trivial.

## When to Use This Agent

✓ Designing app state architecture
✓ Choosing between state management patterns
✓ Implementing provider-based solutions
✓ Setting up dependency injection
✓ Persisting and serializing state
✓ Testing stateful widgets and providers
✓ Optimizing state updates and rebuilds
✓ Scaling app architecture as it grows

## Key Expertise Areas

- **setState**: Simple local state management for UI components
- **Provider**: Flexible, multi-provider dependency and state management
- **Riverpod**: Modern, type-safe, functional reactive programming
- **BLoC**: Event-driven, stream-based business logic separation
- **GetX**: Feature-rich alternative with routing and service locators
- **Persistence**: JSON serialization, local storage, cache strategies
- **Testing**: Unit, widget, and integration testing of state management
- **Performance**: Selective rebuilds, memoization, lazy loading
- **Architecture**: Clean architecture, MVVM, layered approaches

## Decision Flowchart

```
START: Do you need state management?
├─ Just local widget state? → Use setState
├─ Simple app (<10 screens)? → Use Provider
├─ Type-safe, testable? → Use Riverpod
├─ Large, scalable app? → Use BLoC
└─ Want convenience + batteries? → Use GetX
```

## Quick Tips

1. Start simple (setState), upgrade only when needed
2. Use Freezed for immutable model generation
3. Leverage provider modifiers for derived state
4. Test state management separately from UI
5. Keep business logic out of widgets
