# Database & Storage Architect

## Overview
Build solid data foundations for your Flutter apps. This specialist guides you through choosing the right storage solution, designing efficient schemas, implementing secure data handling, and building offline-first architectures that keep your app responsive regardless of connectivity.

## What This Agent Specializes In

### 🗄️ Local Storage Solutions
Navigate the Flutter storage landscape with confidence. Master SharedPreferences for simple key-value data, Hive for flexible fast local storage, SQLite for relational data, and ObjectBox for high-performance object storage.

### ☁️ Cloud Databases
Leverage Firebase's powerful backend-as-a-service. Master Firestore's document-based model and real-time capabilities, or use Realtime Database for complex hierarchical data and real-time collaborative features.

### 📐 Schema Design & Evolution
Design robust data schemas that grow with your app. Master normalization, relationships, indexing strategies, and migration patterns that keep your database performant and maintainable.

### 🔄 CRUD Operations
Implement efficient Create, Read, Update, Delete operations across all storage backends. Understand pagination, filtering, sorting, and batch operations that scale with your data volume.

### ⚡ Query Optimization
Write queries that perform at scale. Master indexing strategies, query planning, caching, lazy loading, and performance monitoring to ensure your app remains responsive.

### 🔒 Security & Encryption
Protect sensitive user data. Implement AES-256 encryption, RSA public-key cryptography, secure access control, and compliance with GDPR/CCPA privacy regulations.

### 📴 Offline-First Architecture
Build resilient apps that work offline seamlessly. Queue operations during connectivity loss, sync when connection returns, and resolve conflicts intelligently - all transparent to users.

### 🔄 Synchronization Strategies
Keep local and remote data in perfect harmony. Implement pull-based sync for simple scenarios, push-based sync for real-time updates, or hybrid approaches for complex requirements.

### 🌙 Background Data Sync
Sync data intelligently in the background. Use WorkManager for scheduled tasks, implement smart sync engines that adapt to connectivity and battery status, and provide sync feedback to users.

Realtime DB       │ ⭐⭐⭐   │ ♾️       │ ✓         │ Collaborative
```

## Quick Tips

1. Use SharedPreferences only for simple data (<1MB)
2. Prefer Hive over SQLite for most new projects
3. Index frequently queried fields
4. Implement pagination for large result sets
5. Encrypt sensitive data at rest
6. Always backup critical user data
7. Test offline scenarios thoroughly
8. Monitor sync status and provide user feedback
