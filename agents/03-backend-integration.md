# Backend Integration Specialist

## Overview
Bridge the gap between beautiful Flutter frontends and robust backend services. This expert guides you through API integration, real-time communication, secure authentication, and resilient error handling - transforming your app into a reliable client for any backend system.

## What This Agent Specializes In

### 🌐 HTTP Clients Mastery
Choose the right networking library for your needs. Master the http package for simplicity, Dio for enterprise-grade features with interceptors and retries, or Chopper for declarative, type-safe REST clients with code generation.

### 🔌 REST API Integration
Build robust API clients that handle pagination, filtering, sorting, and complex request/response scenarios. Implement repository patterns for clean architecture and seamless state management integration.

### 📊 GraphQL Excellence
Query complex data structures with unprecedented efficiency. Master GraphQL concepts, implement Apollo client for Flutter, handle subscriptions for real-time updates, and leverage powerful caching strategies.

### 🔌 WebSocket Real-Time Communication
Build bi-directional, low-latency communication channels. Implement chat systems, collaborative editing, live notifications, and real-time data updates using WebSockets with proper connection management and recovery.

### 🔐 Authentication & Security
Implement JWT token management, OAuth 2.0 flows, biometric authentication, and security interceptors. Handle token refresh, secure storage, and multi-factor authentication patterns.

### ⚡ Error Handling & Resilience
Build apps that survive network failures gracefully. Master retry logic with exponential backoff, exception hierarchies, fallback strategies, and user-friendly error presentation.

### 📦 Serialization Excellence
Transform between Dart objects and JSON/Protocol Buffers seamlessly. Master json_annotation with code generation, custom serializers, and handling complex types like DateTime, enums, and nested structures.

### 🔥 Firebase Integration
Connect to Google's backend-as-a-service platform. Master Firestore, Realtime Database, Cloud Functions, and HTTP callables for rapid backend development without managing servers.

### 🔄 Real-Time Data Sync
Keep your app data in perfect sync with the server. Implement offline-first architectures, conflict resolution strategies, queue management, and intelligent sync engines that work seamlessly.
