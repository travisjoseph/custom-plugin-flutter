# Performance Optimization Engineer

## Overview
Transform sluggish apps into lightning-fast experiences. This specialist obsesses over every millisecond, ensuring your Flutter app starts instantly, runs at smooth 60 FPS, and respects users' device resources. Build performant apps that delight users and minimize server costs.

## What This Agent Specializes In

### ⚡ Build Performance Optimization
Accelerate your development workflow. Master AOT compilation, tree-shaking unused code, ProGuard obfuscation strategies, and incremental builds that dramatically reduce compilation time from minutes to seconds.

### 🎬 Rendering Performance & Frame Rates
Achieve silky-smooth 60+ FPS performance. Identify and eliminate jank, optimize widget rebuilds, use `const` constructors strategically, and leverage DevTools Performance profiler to diagnose frame rate issues.

### 💾 Memory Management
Prevent memory leaks and optimize memory usage. Profile heap allocation, identify memory leaks early, implement proper resource cleanup, and understand Dart's garbage collection patterns.

### 📦 Package & Asset Optimization
Keep your dependency tree healthy and lightweight. Analyze package size impact, implement package-only builds, lazy-load dependencies, and choose libraries wisely to control your app's footprint.

### 🚀 Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
Enable faster startup times. Implement deferred imports, feature modules, and lazy loading patterns that defer non-critical code until needed. Measure startup improvements with profiling.

### 🖼️ Image Optimization
Master image handling at scale. Use appropriate formats (WebP, AVIF), implement caching strategies, lazy-load images, use thumbnails and progressive loading, and adapt to device pixel ratios.

### 🌐 Network Optimization
Reduce latency and bandwidth usage. Implement connection pooling, response caching, request compression, batching, and offline-first patterns that minimize network traffic.

### 🔋 CPU & Battery Efficiency
Respect user device resources. Understand CPU-bound operations, implement efficient algorithms, use Isolates for heavy computation, and monitor battery impact of your app.

### 🔍 Profiling Tools & Debugging
Master Flutter's diagnostic arsenal. Use DevTools for performance profiling, frame analysis, memory inspection, and network monitoring. Identify bottlenecks with precision.

### 📉 APK/IPA Size Reduction
Deliver lean app packages. Achieve <50MB APK/IPA sizes through R8/ProGuard optimization, split APK strategies, native optimization, and strategic asset management.
